The project involved the development of a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model utilizing spaCy. The model was meticulously trained on a diverse dataset comprising examples of both hard skills and soft skills. Its primary objective was to adeptly extract skills from PDF files, demonstrating a versatile application for automated information extraction. The tailored NER model not only showcased the capabilities of spaCy in accurately identifying and categorizing entities but also highlighted the project's significance in streamlining the extraction of valuable information from unstructured data sources like PDF documents.
